# MadisonMetro
A Java program that uses a Binary Search Tree to organize Madison Metro bus schedule data and display the soonest arriving buses at a given stop.

## Overview
MadisonMetro demonstrates the use of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to organize buses by their arrival times and return results in sorted order.  

## Features
- Builds a **Binary Search Tree of buses**, ordered by arrival time.  
- Implements recursive algorithms for adding, searching, and traversing the BST.  
- Includes custom **iterators**:  
  - `BusForwardsIterator` – returns buses after a given time.  
  - `BusFilteredIterator` – filters buses by a destination stop.  
- Provides testing via `BusStopTreeTester` to validate BST operations and iterators.  

## Skills & Concepts
- **Language:** Java  
- **Data Structures:** Binary Search Tree (BST), Iterators  
- **Core Concepts:** Recursion, Object-Oriented Programming, API data integration
